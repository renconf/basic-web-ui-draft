            <h2>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</h2>

            <h2>When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of winter solstice is when the sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole), and the moment of summer solstice is when the sun is at its farthest above the horizon. The date of the winter solstice depends on the geographical location.</h2>

            <h2>Winter, the coldest season in polar and temperate zones, spans about three months from the winter solstice to the vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, and from the winter solstice to the autumnal equinox in the Southern Hemisphere. The season is caused by the Earth's axis tilting away from the Sun, resulting in shorter days and longer nights. The winter solstice, occurring around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, marks the shortest day of the year, with the sun at its lowest elevation in the sky. Weather during winter varies significantly: in temperate regions, it often brings snow and freezing temperatures, while polar regions experience extreme cold and prolonged darkness. Different cultures celebrate winter with various festivals, like Christmas and the Sapporo Snow Festival. Ecologically, many animals hibernate or migrate, and plants enter a dormant phase. Human activities during winter include skiing, ice skating, and enjoying indoor gatherings with warm foods and drinks.</h2>
